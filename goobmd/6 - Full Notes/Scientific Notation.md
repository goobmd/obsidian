# Scientific Notation
Often times in research, scientists may end up with numbers that may be magnitudes larger or magnitudes smaller than what is readable on paper making it much harder to process at a quick glance, leading to the creation of scientific notation. Scientific notation is the use of the powers of 10 rule to simplify larger magnitudes of numbers to be made more readable on paper. 

## Use
Scientific notation is applicable when dealing with numbers with lots of significant zeros, removing these & replacing them with an exponent that denotes the magnitude of the number.

We can simplify these numbers by counting the number of decimal places we need to move to get to the base number (The largest significant digit).
After you move the decimal, multiply the new number with 10 to the power of the number of decimal places moved previously.

Example:
19,256,000,000 => 10 decimal places => 1.9256

Ans: ==1.9256x10^10==
###### Note: This number may also be referred to as 1.9256E^10. This is more often found in scientific calculators.

This may also apply to numbers with much smaller magnitudes. Simply move the decimal to the left rather than the right & add a negative to the exponent

Example:
0.0000357 => 5 decimal places => 3.57

Ans: ==3.57x10^5==

## Purpose
Scientific Notation is often used due to the standard utilized by scientists of standard units & derivatives thereof. Whilst many units may exist in the world such as metres, feet, inches, centimetres, etc, scientists have found that these differences make research harder to follow as conversions may be required to collaborate with their peers. To circumvent this, scientists have chosen to use one standard when publishing research in the community, allowing for much easier communication & understanding. The [[SI Base Units]].
