# States of Matter

## Matter
Matter is defined as the substances that make up our world. For an exact definition, matter:
- Possesses mass
- Occupies space
- Has a definite composition
- Has unique properties

## States

Matter can be placed into one of four physical states: solids, liquids, gases, & plasma.

| States                        | Solids         | Liquids           | Gases           | Plasma               |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| **Arrangement**               | Tightly Packed | Randomly Arranged | Far Away        | Loss of Electrons    |
| **Interaction between Atoms** | Very Strong    | Strong            | Weak            | Shortly Lived        |
| **Movement of Atoms**         | Slow           | Average           | Fast & Straight | Very Fast & Straight |

#### Solids
Solids are tightly packed & rigid. They possess a very strong interaction between atoms with slow movement.
#### Liquids
Liquids are randomly packed & easily affected by outside forces. Atoms still possess strong interaction with moderate movement.
#### Gases
Gases attempt to fill the container they are located. They possess a very scattered arrangement of atoms, that almost seem to repel each other. There is practically no interaction between atoms & movement is faster than solids & liquids in straight paths.
#### Plasma
Plasma occurs when there is so much energy that atoms lose their electrons entirely. They often last for very short durations unless energy present. Movement is very rapid in straight paths. Occurs in stars.

## Phase Changes

Phase changes occur through the addition or removal of pressure and/or temperature. Often, solids form with lower temperatures & higher pressures, gases form with lower pressures & higher temperatures, & liquids form in between.

| States     | Solid                      | Liquid                       | Gas                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Solid**  | X                          | Solid => Liquid = Melting    | Solid => Gas = Sublimation  |
| **Liquid** | Liquid => Solid = Freezing | X                            | Liquid => Gas = Evaporation |
| **Gas**    | Gas => Solid = Deposition  | Gas => Liquid = Condensation | X                           |

#### Solids & Liquids
- When a solid turns into a liquid, the process is referred to as ==melting==.
- When a liquid turns into a solid, the process is referred to as ==freezing==.

#### Liquids & Gases
- When a gas turns into a liquid, the process is referred to as ==condensation==.
- When a liquid turns into a gas, the process is referred to as ==evaporation==.

#### Gases & Solids
- When a solid turns into a gas, the process is referred to as ==sublimation==.
- When a gas turns into a solid, the process is referred to as ==deposition==.

#### Triple Point
- The pressure & temperature at which all 3 states of matter coexist.

#### Critical Point
- The pressure & temperature that, when passed, cause a gas or liquid to become a supercritical fluid. Supercritical fluids may possess some properties of gases & some properties of liquids.
