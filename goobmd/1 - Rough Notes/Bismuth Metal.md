There's a new sound I want to create adding in elements of doom metal as well as funk & hip-hop I would name Bismuth Metal, originating from the colourful element found in nature that seems almost pearlescent.

I would use deep booming drums similar to tribal drums or those found in 808's & Heartbreak. I would also use some faders on these drums similar to the technique used by JPEGMAFIA. Finally, I want lots of rolls with kicks & hi-hats to create a cool foundation for everything else to sit on.

The primary sound would consist of 2 guitars & two basses each being tuned to reach differing soundscapes. 1 guitar & 1 bass would be tuned down to create power riffs & simple basslines whilst the uptuned guitar & bass would be used to create funky J-Pop like basslines & sounds similar to those used by The Stooges in Ann. 

## Instruments

Drums - Switch between kicks & hi-hats filling as constants with the mids pushed forward to create a swing. Use faders on kicks for extra punch.

Doom Guitar - Down tuned with bass strings, used to create power riffs that serve as the base for the rest of the soundscape.

Doom Bass - Normal Bass with slight down tune used in conjunction with the doom guitar to create a simple base.

Sludge Guitar - Used to create a sludge metal feel, similar to Ann by the Stooges.

Funk Bass - Used to create funky bass lines that pull everything else together, similar to J-Pop basslines.
