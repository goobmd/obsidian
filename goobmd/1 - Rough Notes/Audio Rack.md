I had an idea to create an audio rack to use as a sort of portable studio with the capability to plug in various instruments and mix all of them on the go. To call it one mega rack is a lie as I would likely split the racks depending on the various instruments I would like to record.

## Base Design

I believe the racks would be placed in military grade server racks similar to the cases Pelican sells on their website. This is open to change however, as I would like the racks to be stackable & with the capability to move on wheels to easily transport them between studios if needed. All equipment would likely be rack mounted with few exceptions & I would like the racks to be fitted with patchbays for easy access of I/O as well as connections between racks that may be kinked out later.

SKB Racks are nice.

## Primary Rack

This rack will handle all the DAW operations, allow for connections to up to 18 channels & supply power for any other rack. 

The primary rack will contain:
	* Samson S-Patch Plus (1U)
	* DIY KVM Monitor (1U)
	* Mini ITX server (1U)
	* Scarlett 18i20 Audio Interface (1U)
	* Scarlett Octopre Preamp; ADAT Expander (1U)
	* Furman Power Conditioner (1U)
	6U in total

* The patchbay included has support for Normal, Half-Normal, & Thru modes. It will mostly be used with connectivity with the Scarlett channels for integration with other racks.

* The DIY KVM Monitor is just a fancy name for a popout monitor & mouse & keyboard so I can access the ITX server. The monitor will likely be cheap and attached to a rackmounted cabinet with a hinge. the keyboard will be custom-made from the PCB with a 40% layout with mandatory bluetooth connectivity. The mouse can reallyn be anything if it has bluetooth but a trackball mouse would likely be best. Alternatively, I could run the server through a shitty chromebook.

* The Mini ITX server will likely be fairly budget with a nice quad or 8 core AMD Ryzen CPU with 16GB of RAM, 256GB M.2 Drive with a minimal Linux install as well as a DAW program & the necessary programs & drivers needed. Finally, a PCIE slot will be used featuring a removable SATA bay for easy storage of projects. The PCIE out would be best placed in the front of the server. Furthermore, I would like there to be an abundance of USB ports placed in the back of the server for various connections.

* Both Scarlett devices will be used as 1 large audio interface to connect to any instruments that may be used directly to the server to be mixed in the DAW. I had used a Scarlett 18i20 chained with an Octopre to allow for 18 channels to be used in total as well as the large communities behind them, in particular the 18i20 as well as its close cousin. 

* Finally, the Furman Power Conditioner will largely be used to supply power to the server as well as any other components. In particular components from other racks such as a guitar/bass pedalboard will likely use the front outlet extensively to supply their power.
